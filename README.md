# tdd-fibonacci

TDD JavaScript implementation of Fibonacci series function

## What is this project about?

This project demonstrates a [Test-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) (TDD) approach to writing a JavaScript function to calculate a given element of the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).
